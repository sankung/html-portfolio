<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My unwavering passion for education and research has driven my journey towards becoming a medical doctor. 
  Starting with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, I deepened my knowledge with a Master of Biomedical 
  Sciences at the Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine exposed me to cutting-edge research in medicine.</p>

<p>Research has been a core part of my academic pursuit. As an Undergraduate Research Assistant, I explored the 
  world of flavonoids and synthesized organic compounds to enhance their biological effects. My dedication to 
  scientific inquiry culminated in a publication investigating ketamine's potential as a rapid antidepressant 
  for treatment-resistant depression during my graduate studies.</p>

<p>While research has been immensely fulfilling, my ultimate goal is to become a medical doctor. Hands-on clinical 
  experience as a Medical Assistant and Patient Care Technician strengthened my desire to combine scientific 
  knowledge with compassionate patient care.</p>

<p>My journey is a testament to my passion for medicine and unwavering commitment to positively impact patients' 
  lives. I eagerly anticipate the next phase of my career as a medical doctor, where I can contribute to advancing 
  healthcare and provide exceptional patient care.</p>
